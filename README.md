# Assignment3


The PDF should contain all the images except only one lighting image right now as I don't know if it looks correct. 
It will also contain the answers to questions in relevant parts.

The function EstimateCameraProjectionMatrix takes impoints2D,objpoints3D and outputs the M matrix. Then the function findEstimates takes M and objpoints3D and creates 
the 3d point estimates.

Createred_blueplot script outputs the image with red and blue dots for the clicks and 3d estimates. 

Mesh_overlay creates the mesh overlay images as well as the lighting images

Test3 is what I used to create the points arrays as well as calculating the average for the difference
